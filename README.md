# numerical_methods_for_dynamical_systems
Numerical exercises regarding the reduced three body problem (RTBP). This code was made by me as answers to the exercises in the cource at UPC called "Numerical methods for dynamical systems". In addition, there are some other scripts that fall outside the course work.
