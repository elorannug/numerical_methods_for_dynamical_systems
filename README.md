# numerical_methods_for_dynamical_systems
This repo contains different exercises, notes & project regarding dynamical systems. The repo is split into 3 parts: 

### 3 Body Problem
Contains some simulations and qualitative analysis regarding the 3 body problem

This folder also contains an analysis of the Sitnikov problem (*Done as an exercise in the course qualitative and quantitative methods for dynamical systems at Barcelonatech*)

Numerical exercises regarding the reduced three body problem (RTBP). This code was made by me as answers to the exercises in the cource at UPC called "Numerical methods for dynamical systems". In addition, there are some other scripts that fall outside the course work.
